# SAS Programming for CLinical Trials

## Types of Clinical Trials

## Drug/Device developement process

- Basic Research > Non-clinical studies > Clinical Studies > New Drug application and Review > Approval and launch > Post marketing Surveillance (Phase 4)
    - `Phase I` - **Safety** in healthy (sample 10-20)
    - `Phase II` - **Effectiveness** and safety dose in **patients** (sample ~ 200)
    - `Phase III` - Safety and Efficacy **comparison** to other treatments (1000+) - more likely to detect rate side effects
    - `Phase IV` - Post-marketing surveillance

- **Single Blind** - patients do not know
- **Double Blind** - Neither patients nor doctors know
- **Tipple blind** - Even the statisticians do not know, nor patients nor doctors

- Device Approval process
    - Class 1 - surgical instruments
    - Class 2 - infusion pumps motorized wheel chairs
    - Class 3 - highest risk devices: heart valves, implantations

## Regulations
- **Fedral laws** 
    - `21 CFR (Code of fedral regulations) - Part 11`, electronic records and signatures to FDA
        - The person must be qualified to do your work. Must have a degree
        - Programming must be validated - compared with another statistical programmer
        - Must have system security - Not every person can access the data
        - Change control procedures for SAS programming - Versions of the program will be documented. It should be documented why there are 2 versions of the program after finalized
    - `HIPA` - Only a patient's **initials** and **date of birth** can be collected

- **Fedral Guidelines** (eCTDs - Electronic Common Technical Documents)
    - `Study data standards` - Standards of Electronic Submissions of data to FDA
        - Data must be submitted in `SDTM` and `ADaM` formats
    - Other
        - CDER Common Data Standards Issues Document
        - CDER Data Standards Program

- **Industry Regulations** and Standards (ICH, CDISC)
    - `ICH E3 - Structure and content` of Clinical Study Reports - **Clinical study report for FDA submission** - deals with what must be the contents of these reports
    - `ICH E9 - Statistical principals` for clinical trials - Statistical issues for the design and conduct of a clinical trial. For example intent to treat and safety populations
    - `ICH E6 - Good Clinical Practice`: Consolidated Guidance - Overall standards
