# SAS Programming for CLinical Trials

## Types of Clinical Trials

## Drug/Device developement process

- Basic Research > Non-clinical studies > Clinical Studies > New Drug application and Review > Approval and launch > Post marketing Surveillance (Phase 4)
    - `Phase I` - **Safety** in healthy (sample 10-20)
    - `Phase II` - **Effectiveness** and safety dose in **patients** (sample ~ 200)
    - `Phase III` - Safety and Efficacy **comparison** to other treatments (1000+) - more likely to detect rate side effects
    - `Phase IV` - Post-marketing surveillance

- **Single Blind** - patients do not know
- **Double Blind** - Neither patients nor doctors know
- **Tipple blind** - Even the statisticians do not know, nor patients nor doctors

- Device Approval process
    - Class 1 - surgical instruments
    - Class 2 - infusion pumps motorized wheel chairs
    - Class 3 - highest risk devices: heart valves, implantations

## Regulations
    - Fedral laws
    - Fedral Guidelines (eCTDs)
    - Industry Regulations and Standards (ICH, CDISC)
